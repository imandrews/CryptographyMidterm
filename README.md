# CryptographyMidterm
Midterm Project for ECE:5995:

For this midterm project, you are to implement a subset of the US Governmentâ€™s Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES). Specifically, you should implement AES for the 128-bit key size. For your
implementation, you may use any language you prefer (python, C(++), C#, Ruby, etc.), but you may
not use any high-level functions (APIs, libraries, modules, etc.) that support development of an AES
implementation. The spirit of this requirement is that you should implement all of the required structure
to build the AES primitive by yourself. Standard libraries are acceptable for use.
